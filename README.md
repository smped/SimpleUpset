The package `SimpleUpset` provides the capability for creating UpSet plots, 
using a combination of `ggplot` and `patchwork` to put the figures together.
In addition to the simple UpSet plots, additional panels can be added above 
the intersections to allow more informative plotting.

This package is currently in active development and should be considered unstable
